Ideas to help with my kids bedtime stories

When I read a bedtime story to my kids, they always ask for "pretend stories" which was Poppy's name for where I have to tell them a story based on a character and scenario they think of.

Recurring themes are ninja turtles and bad guys for Finn and Toby, and Poppy and her friends getting up to mischief, but sometimes I get tired of telling effectively the same story every night.

When I saw a mates' story cubes I thought there must be something equivalent online, and tried to find one for that night's pretend stories - I couldn't find anything, so I made one myself!
